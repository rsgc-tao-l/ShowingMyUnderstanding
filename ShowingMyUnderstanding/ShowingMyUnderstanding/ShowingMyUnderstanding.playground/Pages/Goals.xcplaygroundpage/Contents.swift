 # Goals
 
 In this playground, you will be asked to create:
 
 * a simple example where *sequence of statements matters*
 * a simple example that uses *conditionals* ("if" statements) to make a decision based on random number generation
 * a simple example that uses one or more *iteration structures* ("loops")
 * a more interesting example that combines all of the above
 
 On each page, you need to demonstrate:
 
 * how to write human-readable code
 * effective use of source control
 
 On any of the pages, by creating a comment in your code, please identify at least once:
 
 * where you are using comparison operators
 * where you are using arithmetic operators
 * where you are using variables
 * where you are using assignment statements
 
 Remember:
 
 * be sure you *forked* and then cloned this repository
 * commit your work every time you make progress toward completing the assignment
 
 **Due date:** The assignment is due, without exception, by the start of our next class (Monday, February 27, 2017).
 
 Let's get started!
